Easy eCommerce Order Management

== Description ==

This plugin integrates your existing WooCommerce store with CrossPeak OMS.

CrossPeak is an eCommerce order management system that will help you
manage web orders for your unique products â€“ like subscriptions,
digital content, bespoke goods or perishable items. With additional
modules for call center integration, pick and ship and point of sale,
we can help you reach your peak.

CrossPeak is designed to deliver a great customer experience for
companies with virtual and flex inventory products.

Unlike other OMS products, CrossPeak is not a warehouse management tool,
it is focused on delivering a connected customer experience after the
sale of any virtual or unique inventory product through a permission
based workflow. Customer Services, Call Center, 3PL partners and
management teams all enjoy different levels of access to the same order
data to provide a customer first ecosystem.
